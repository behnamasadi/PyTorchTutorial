# 2) Choose architecture
# 2-1) Weight initialization
# I) xavier
# II) kaiming-he
# 2-2) Check if the loss is reasonable
# I) Disable regularization, do a forward and check the loss
# II) Crank up the regularization and the loss should goes up,
# III) Feed a small portion of data, turn off regularization, it should easily overfit
# and loss goes to zero, train accuracy =1

# batch normalization
# drop out



# plotting

# donâ€™t use autograd of not necessary (use with torch.no_grad() if possible)
# only push tensors to GPU, if they are actually needed
# try to avoid loops over tensor dimensions (slows things down)
# try to free graphs as soon as possible (use detach or item whenever you can) to avoid memory leaks
