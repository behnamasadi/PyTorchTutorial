    "GitHub Actions' standard hosted runners (`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, etc.) do **not** provide GPU access or CUDA support. The solution is to:\n",

    "1. **Use standard CPU-only runners** (`ubuntu-latest`) for CI\n",
    "2. **Implement device detection** in your code that automatically falls back to CPU when CUDA is unavailable\n",
    "3. **Test on CPU** in CI, knowing your code will work on GPU when available locally\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures:\n",
    "- ✅ Tests run successfully on GitHub Actions (CPU)\n",
    "- ✅ Code works on local machines with GPU (CUDA)\n",
    "- ✅ Code gracefully handles both environments\n",
    "- ✅ No additional costs or infrastructure needed\n",

    "\n",
    "To make your code work in both GPU and CPU environments, implement device detection in your scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "\n",
    "# Detect device and fall back to CPU if CUDA is not available\n",
    "device = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n",
    "print(f\"Using device: {device}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the device for your tensors/models\n",
    "model = model.to(device)\n",
    "data = data.to(device)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Training Script\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "import torch.nn as nn\n",
    "\n",
    "# Device detection\n",
    "device = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n",
    "print(f\"Training on device: {device}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Model setup\n",
    "model = nn.Linear(10, 1).to(device)\n",
    "criterion = nn.MSELoss()\n",
    "optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Training loop\n",
    "for epoch in range(10):\n",
    "    # Generate dummy data on the correct device\n",
    "    inputs = torch.randn(32, 10).to(device)\n",
    "    targets = torch.randn(32, 1).to(device)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Forward pass\n",
    "    outputs = model(inputs)\n",
    "    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Backward pass\n",
    "    optimizer.zero_grad()\n",
    "    loss.backward()\n",
    "    optimizer.step()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(f\"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always check CUDA availability**: Use `torch.cuda.is_available()` before using CUDA\n",
    "2. **Move tensors to device explicitly**: Use `.to(device)` for all tensors and models\n",
    "3. **Print device info**: Helpful for debugging and logging\n",
    "4. **Handle device mismatches**: Ensure all tensors in operations are on the same device\n",

    "## Testing Locally\n",
    "\n",
    "Before pushing to GitHub, test your workflow locally using one of two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Manual Testing (Fast & Simple)\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the workflow commands directly in your environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Navigate to your project directory\n",
    "cd /home/$USERNAME/workspace/PyTorchTutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "# Activate your conda environment (if using conda)\n",
    "conda activate PyTorchTutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the workflow steps manually\n",
    "python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n",
    "pip install pytest numpy torch\n",
    "pytest --ignore=projects\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 2: Using `act` (Full Simulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "`act` is a tool that runs GitHub Actions workflows locally using Docker, providing a more accurate simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended way to install **GitHub CLI (gh)** on Ubuntu \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install prerequisites**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt update\n",
    "sudo apt install -y curl gpg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add GitHub CLI GPG key**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \\\n",
    "  | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add the official apt repository**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) \\\n",
    "signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] \\\n",
    "https://cli.github.com/packages stable main\" \\\n",
    "  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Install gh**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt update\n",
    "sudo apt install gh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Verify**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gh --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **GitHub CLI Extension**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gh extension install nektos/gh-act\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then use it as: `gh act` instead of just `act`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verify Installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, verify it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "act --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a config file to avoid interactive prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir -p ~/.config/act\n",
    "echo \"-P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest\" > ~/.config/act/actrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** `catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest` is a pre-built Docker image maintained by the act community. It simulates GitHub Actions' Ubuntu runner environment. You don't need to change this name - it's the standard image used by `act` to replicate GitHub Actions behavior locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Navigate to your project directory\n",
    "cd /home/$USERNAME/workspace/PyTorchTutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "# List what would run (dry-run)\n",
    "act push --list\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the workflow\n",
    "act push -W .github/workflows/ci.yml\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run specific workflow file\n",
    "act push -W .github/workflows/ci.yml -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Simulates exact GitHub Actions environment\n",
    "- Uses Docker containers like GitHub Actions\n",
    "- Catches environment-specific issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Slower (downloads Docker images)\n",
    "- Requires Docker to be installed and running\n",
    "- First run takes longer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common `act` Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# List available workflows\n",
    "act -l\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run specific job\n",
    "act -j test\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run with specific event\n",
    "act push\n",
    "act pull_request\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run specific workflow file\n",
    "act -W .github/workflows/ci.yml\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show what would run without executing\n",
    "act --list\n",
