    "## 1. What is XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explainable AI (XAI)** is the set of techniques and methods that make the decision-making process of AI systems **transparent, understandable, and trustworthy** for humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just giving a prediction (like \"this patient has cancer\" or \"this image contains a cat\"), XAI also provides the **reasons why** the model made that prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Types of Explainability\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) **Global Explainability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explains how the **entire model** works.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: “This decision tree splits first on age, then on income.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) **Local Explainability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explains **individual predictions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: “This loan application was rejected because of high debt-to-income ratio.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Techniques in XAI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-specific (built-in explainability):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decision Trees** – easy to interpret.\n",
    "* **Linear Regression** – coefficients directly show feature influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-agnostic (post-hoc explanations):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**\n",
    "  Explains predictions by approximating the model locally with simpler models.\n",
    "* **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**\n",
    "  Uses game theory to fairly distribute importance across features.\n",
    "* **Counterfactual Explanations**\n",
    "  Show “what needs to change” to flip the prediction (e.g., “If income were \\$50k instead of \\$40k, the loan would be approved”).\n",
    "* **Saliency Maps / Grad-CAM**\n",
    "  In deep learning, highlight parts of an image/text that influenced the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Challenges in XAI\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Trade-off between accuracy and interpretability** (deep neural networks are powerful but hard to interpret).\n",
    "* **Complexity vs simplicity**: Too simple explanations may be misleading, too complex explanations may confuse users.\n",
    "* **Human factors**: Explanations must be understandable to the target audience (doctors, regulators, customers, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Healthcare**: Why did the AI predict a tumor? (highlight regions in MRI scans).\n",
    "* **Finance**: Why was a credit card transaction flagged as fraud?\n",
    "* **Autonomous Vehicles**: Why did the car decide to brake?\n",
    "* **Hiring**: Why was a candidate rejected by the AI system?\n",
