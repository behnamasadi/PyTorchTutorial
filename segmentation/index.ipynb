    "### **Overview of Model Architectures**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FCN (Fully Convolutional Network)**  \n",
    "   - **Concept**: Introduced in 2015, FCN was one of the first architectures for semantic segmentation, replacing fully connected layers in traditional CNNs with convolutional layers to produce pixel-wise predictions. It uses a backbone (e.g., VGG or ResNet) for feature extraction, followed by upsampling to recover spatial resolution.  \n",
    "   - **Architecture**:  \n",
    "     - **Encoder**: A pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) extracts features at multiple scales, producing feature maps of decreasing resolution.  \n",
    "     - **Upsampling**: Uses transposed convolutions or bilinear upsampling to restore the feature map to the input image size.  \n",
    "     - **Skip Connections**: Combines feature maps from earlier layers with upsampled outputs to recover spatial details lost during downsampling.  \n",
    "     - **Output**: A pixel-wise classification map with class probabilities.  \n",
    "   - **Pros**: Simple concept, leverages pre-trained backbones, good baseline for segmentation.  \n",
    "   - **Cons**: Can struggle with fine details due to coarse upsampling, less sophisticated than newer models.  \n",
    "   - **Use Case**: General-purpose semantic segmentation, foundational for later models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **U-Net**  \n",
    "   - **Concept**: Introduced in 2015 for medical imaging, U-Net is designed for precise segmentation with limited data. Its symmetric encoder-decoder structure resembles a \"U\" shape, hence the name. It’s highly intuitive and effective for small datasets.  \n",
    "   - **Architecture**:  \n",
    "     - **Encoder (Contracting Path)**: A series of convolutional and max-pooling layers that downsample the input image to extract features at multiple scales.  \n",
    "     - **Decoder (Expanding Path)**: Symmetric upsampling layers (via transposed convolutions or interpolation) to recover spatial resolution.  \n",
    "     - **Skip Connections**: Concatenates feature maps from the encoder to the decoder at each level, preserving fine-grained spatial details.  \n",
    "     - **Output**: A dense pixel-wise classification map.  \n",
    "   - **Pros**:  \n",
    "     - Simple and symmetric design, easy to understand.  \n",
    "     - Highly effective for small datasets (common in medical imaging).  \n",
    "     - Skip connections help retain fine details, making it great for precise boundaries.  \n",
    "   - **Cons**: Less flexible for very deep architectures or complex tasks compared to DeepLab. May require modifications for large-scale datasets.  \n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Medical imaging (e.g., cell segmentation, organ segmentation), small-scale datasets, or when precise boundaries are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DeepLab**  \n",
    "   - **Concept**: Developed by Google, DeepLab (v1–v3+) is a family of models that use atrous (dilated) convolutions and advanced techniques to capture multi-scale context and improve segmentation accuracy. It’s more complex but highly effective for large-scale datasets.  \n",
    "   - **Architecture (DeepLabv3+ as an example)**:  \n",
    "     - **Encoder**: Uses a backbone (e.g., ResNet, Xception) with atrous convolutions to maintain higher-resolution feature maps and capture multi-scale context.  \n",
    "     - **Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP)**: Applies atrous convolutions at different rates to capture features at multiple scales.  \n",
    "     - **Decoder**: Upsamples the feature maps and refines boundaries using low-level features from the backbone.  \n",
    "     - **Output**: A refined pixel-wise segmentation map.  \n",
    "   - **Pros**:  \n",
    "     - Excels at capturing multi-scale context, ideal for complex scenes (e.g., autonomous driving).  \n",
    "     - State-of-the-art performance on large datasets like Cityscapes or PASCAL VOC.  \n",
    "   - **Cons**:  \n",
    "     - More complex to understand and implement due to atrous convolutions and ASPP.  \n",
    "     - Computationally intensive, requiring more resources.  \n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Large-scale, complex datasets like urban scene segmentation or natural images.\n",
